# Aura AI Investment Agent - Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the Aura AI Investment Agent platform to production. Follow these steps to ensure a successful deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Testing Verification
- [ ] All unit tests for each service are passing
- [ ] Integration tests are passing
- [ ] End-to-end tests are passing
- [ ] Performance testing has been completed and meets targets
- [ ] Security testing has been completed

### 2. Infrastructure Preparation
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster is set up and properly configured
- [ ] Namespaces `aura` and `monitoring` are created
- [ ] Required storage classes are available
- [ ] Network policies are configured
- [ ] Ingress controller is deployed and configured
- [ ] TLS certificates are obtained and configured

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL instance is provisioned (managed service or in Kubernetes)
- [ ] InfluxDB instance is provisioned
- [ ] Neo4j instance is provisioned (if using graph database features)
- [ ] Database backups are configured
- [ ] Database access credentials are securely stored

### 4. Secrets Management
- [ ] Kubernetes Secrets are created for sensitive data:
  - [ ] Database credentials
  - [ ] API keys (Alpaca, NewsAPI, etc.)
  - [ ] JWT secret key
  - [ ] Other credentials
- [ ] Verify no secrets are hardcoded in configuration or Docker images

### 5. Configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific ConfigMaps are created
- [ ] Feature flags are properly set for production
- [ ] Service URLs are configured correctly for inter-service communication
- [ ] External service endpoints are configured

### 6. Resources and Scaling
- [ ] CPU and memory requests/limits are set appropriately for each service
- [ ] Horizontal Pod Autoscalers are configured for relevant services
- [ ] Initial replica counts are set based on expected load

### 7. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Prometheus is deployed and configured
- [ ] Grafana is deployed with dashboards
- [ ] Alerting rules are configured
- [ ] Log aggregation system is deployed (e.g., EFK stack)
- [ ] Application metrics endpoints are properly configured

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is tested and working
- [ ] Image building and pushing is configured correctly
- [ ] Deployment automation is tested

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
- [ ] Take snapshot/backup of existing databases (if applicable)
- [ ] Run any required database schema migrations
- [ ] Verify database connectivity from Kubernetes

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure Components
- [ ] Deploy Kafka/message broker
- [ ] Deploy Redis (if used for caching)
- [ ] Deploy other infrastructure services

### 3. Deploy Core Services
- [ ] Deploy services in dependency order:
  1. Auth Service
  2. Data Ingestion Service
  3. Data Processing Service
  4. Other backend services
  5. API Gateway Service
  6. Frontend deployment

### 4. Verify Deployments
- [ ] Verify all pods are running successfully
- [ ] Check readiness/liveness probe status
- [ ] Verify service-to-service communication
- [ ] Check API Gateway routing

### 5. DNS and TLS Configuration
- [ ] Configure DNS records to point to the service
- [ ] Verify TLS certificates are working correctly
- [ ] Test external access

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. System Health Check
- [ ] Verify Prometheus metrics are being collected
- [ ] Check Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Verify log collection is working
- [ ] Check alert system

### 2. Functional Verification
- [ ] Verify user authentication flow
- [ ] Verify core application workflows
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections for real-time data
- [ ] Test integration with third-party services (Alpaca, etc.)

### 3. Performance Validation
- [ ] Monitor resource usage under normal load
- [ ] Verify latency metrics meet targets
- [ ] Check for any obvious bottlenecks

### 4. Security Verification
- [ ] Verify network policies are working correctly
- [ ] Confirm services are only exposing intended ports
- [ ] Verify JWT authentication is working properly
- [ ] Verify authorization checks are functioning

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues, follow this rollback plan:

1. **Issues with a Single Service:**
   - Revert to previous image version using `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<service-name> -n aura`
   - Verify service returns to stable state

2. **Database Schema Issues:**
   - Restore from pre-migration backup
   - Revert service deployments to compatible versions

3. **Complete Deployment Failure:**
   - Revert all deployments to previous versions
   - Restore database from backup if needed
   - Update DNS to previous environment if applicable

## Post-Deployment Monitoring Period

After deployment, closely monitor the system for at least 24 hours:

- [ ] Set up a monitoring rotation schedule
- [ ] Define escalation paths for different types of issues
- [ ] Document any observed issues or anomalies
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review meeting

## Future Improvements

Document observations and improvement ideas for future deployments:

- [ ] Pipeline improvements
- [ ] Configuration management improvements
- [ ] Monitoring enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
