# Aura AI Investment Agent - Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Aura AI Investment Agent platform, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Backend Services
Each microservice should have dedicated unit tests covering:
- Core business logic in service layers
- Data transformations and processing
- API endpoint validation
- Error handling

**Implementation:**
- Use `pytest` for all Python services
- Unit test files should be located in a `tests/unit` directory within each service
- Mock external dependencies (databases, Kafka, HTTP calls)
- Aim for >80% code coverage for critical logic

**Example Unit Test Structure (for each service):**
```
services/{service-name}/
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── unit/
  │   │   ├── test_api.py      # Tests for API endpoints
  │   │   ├── test_models.py   # Tests for data models
  │   │   ├── test_service.py  # Tests for service logic
  │   │   └── conftest.py      # Pytest fixtures
```

#### Frontend
For the React/TypeScript frontend:
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Focus on component unit tests and custom hooks
- Test utility functions and state management

**Example Frontend Unit Test Structure:**
```
frontend/src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── __tests__/
  │   │   └── ComponentName.test.tsx
  ├── hooks/
  │   ├── __tests__/
  │   │   └── useHookName.test.ts
```

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests should verify the interaction between services and components, focusing on:
- Service-to-service communication
- Database and message queue interactions
- API Gateway routing

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create a dedicated `integration-tests` directory at the project root
- Use containerized test environment with Docker Compose
- Implement tests using pytest for backend and Cypress for frontend-to-backend integration

**Key Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Order Flow**: Frontend -> API Gateway -> Brokerage Integration -> Order Confirmation
   - Verify the entire order placement flow (buy/sell)
   - Test limit/market order types
   - Verify order status updates

2. **Data Processing Flow**: Data Ingestion -> Processing -> Storage -> Frontend Display
   - Test market data ingestion and processing
   - Verify calculations for indicators
   - Validate data storage and retrieval

3. **Alert System**: Data Processing -> Alert Detection -> Frontend Notification
   - Test alert rule creation
   - Verify alert detection when conditions are met
   - Test notification delivery

4. **Authentication Flow**: Login -> JWT Validation -> Protected Endpoint Access
   - Test login/registration process
   - Verify token validation
   - Test unauthorized access attempts

### 3. End-to-End Testing

E2E tests should validate complete user journeys from the frontend through all services.

**Implementation:**
- Use Cypress or Playwright
- Focus on critical user flows
- Run against containerized services

**Primary E2E Test Scenarios:**

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - Complete signup process
   - Verify email verification (if implemented)
   - Login with credentials
   - Test password reset flow

2. **Portfolio Management**
   - View portfolio dashboard
   - View individual asset details
   - Check performance metrics
   - Test filters and sorting

3. **Trading Flow**
   - Search for assets
   - View market data
   - Place simulated trade
   - Confirm order execution
   - View updated portfolio

4. **Alert Configuration**
   - Create various alert types
   - Edit existing alerts
   - Delete alerts
   - Receive and view notifications

5. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Configure risk parameters
   - Request optimization
   - View and apply recommendations

## Test Environment Setup

### Local Development Testing
- Use Docker Compose to run required services
- Configure services to use in-memory/containerized databases
- Mock external API calls (Alpaca, News API)

### CI/CD Pipeline Testing
- Implement automated testing in GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Run unit tests for each service on every commit
- Run integration tests on PR to main branches
- Run E2E tests nightly or before deployment

## Test Data Management
- Create standardized seed data for testing
- Implement data reset between test runs
- Use fixture factories for generating test data

## Mocking External Services
- Create mock implementations of external APIs (Alpaca, NewsAPI)
- Use mock broker implementation for order simulation
- Implement controlled test scenarios for market data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Testing Foundation
1. Implement unit test framework for each service
2. Create initial high-priority unit tests
3. Configure test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Set up integration test environment
2. Implement critical integration test scenarios
3. Integrate with CI/CD

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing
1. Set up E2E test framework
2. Implement core user journey tests
3. Configure browser-based testing in CI/CD
